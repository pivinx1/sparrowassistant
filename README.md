# Why is everything chopped up so much?
I'm aiming for Sparrow to be as modular as possible. However, this could bring on things like menu overload.

Feedback is useful, so if you want to report a bug or suggest something, hop over to the Issues tab and create an issue.

# Using Sparrow
Well, this thing isn't complete. In it's current state it doesn't have anything **remotely useful**.
But if you insist on using it...

Step 1. Download the code and extract the archive somewhere.

Step 2. Open the command line, navigate to the directory Sparrow is in

Step 3. Run `python core.py` (only on Windows) or `python3 core.py`

# Where did everything go?
The current main branch has been prepared for a rewrite.
As Sparrow is going to be rewritten from scratch, the main branch has been mostly cleared out.
Anything that was in the main branch before the rewrite is in the legacy-main branch.
